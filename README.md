* **Dataset:** `manufacturing_parts` table, containing `item_no`, `length`, `width`, `height`, and `operator` data.
* **Key Analysis:** Calculated Upper/Lower Control Limits (UCL/LCL) for product height; identified out-of-control parts and operator performance.
* **Tools used:** SQL (PostgreSQL) for data analysis and SPC calculations.
* **Outcome:** Found 57 out of 363 parts out of control, with Operator 5 having the most alerts, leading to recommendations for root cause analysis and training.
